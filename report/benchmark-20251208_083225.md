## Cache Performance Impact

Comparing **Bun Server** (no cache) vs **Bun Server (Cached)** with 2-day TTL:

| Metric | Without Cache | With Cache | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Requests/sec | 22572.25 | 42625.89 | 88.84% |
| Latency | 4.44ms | 2.34ms | - |
| Transfer/sec | 27.98MB | 56.02MB | - |

> **Cache Hit Performance:** 1.9x faster than no-cache baseline

The cached server eliminates React SSR rendering on cache hits, serving pre-rendered HTML directly from memory.

## Cache Performance Impact

Comparing **Bun Server** (no cache) vs **Bun Server (Cached)** with 2-day TTL:

| Metric | Without Cache | With Cache | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Requests/sec | 23563.51 | 41606.79 | 76.57% |
| Latency | 4.25ms | 2.40ms | - |
| Transfer/sec | 29.21MB | 54.68MB | - |

> **Cache Hit Performance:** 1.8x faster than no-cache baseline

The cached server eliminates React SSR rendering on cache hits, serving pre-rendered HTML directly from memory.

## Cache Performance Impact

Comparing **Bun Server** (no cache) vs **Bun Server (Cached)** with 2-day TTL:

| Metric | Without Cache | With Cache | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Requests/sec | 24101.15 | 40635.59 | 68.60% |
| Latency | 4.16ms | 2.46ms | - |
| Transfer/sec | 29.88MB | 53.40MB | - |

> **Cache Hit Performance:** 1.7x faster than no-cache baseline

The cached server eliminates React SSR rendering on cache hits, serving pre-rendered HTML directly from memory.
